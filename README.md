Binary Search Tree Project
[7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] Binary-Search-Tree

The root number is 5.

Since 1 is smaller than 5, it is placed left of the root number. 
Also, 7 is placed right of the root because it is higher than 5.
8 is bigger than 7, so it is placed right of the 7.
3 is bigger than 1 but smaller than 5. It is placed right of the 1.
6 is bigger than the root number but smaller than 7. It is placed to the left of the 7.
0 is the smallest number so it is in the left of 1.
Since 9 is the biggest number here, it is placed right of the 8.
4 is smaller than 5 but bigger than 3, so it is placed to the right of 3.
2 is smaller than 3 but bigger than 1, and it is placed to the left of 3.
